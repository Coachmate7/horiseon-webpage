# horiseon-webpage

On my first commit i started by opening the index and tested all the functions to see if there was any code not functioning correctly.
i discovered that the button at the top labeled "SEARCH-ENGINE-OPTIMIZATION" was not working so i fixed that by linking the css ID to it in the div.

i then tidied up the paragraphs alittle in the html.

then i added alts and titles to all the images on the page for accessability.

finally i compressed the css files to do the same thing since there were multiple codes doing the same thing.
